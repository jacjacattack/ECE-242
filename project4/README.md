BigNumberCalculator.java

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------------------------
We assumed that the code provided to us via the PDF was correct.  Since our files produce output identical to what is on the PDF for BigNumberCalculator, we assume that our code will work correctly on other tests you may perform on the code. We also performed additional test cases to double check that the code performed correctly.  We also assume that no null values will be entered into the calculator.

Extra Credit
-----------------------------
We were able to complete both of the extra credit components to this project.  All of our operations are able to handle both positive and negative numbers.  We created the method "divide" to perform division, and edited BigNumberCalculator.java to be able to perform this operation as well for testing purposes.  To divide, enter "/" after the main prompt.
